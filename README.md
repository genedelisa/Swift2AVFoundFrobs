# Swift2AVFoundFrobs


"Improvements" to Core Audio. 

The new `AVAudioSequencer` doesn't work.

Update: in Xcode 7 beta 3 it stopped crashing.
So, yay.

The API is still baffling. What are you supposed to do with `AVMusicTrack`s?
You can't access their content (e.g. add or remove events). All you can do is play them.

Once a `Sequencer` has MIDI data, you cannot see the data to verify anything.


## Blog post for this example.

## SoundFont

You will need to download a SoundFont. I use the one from [MuseCore](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/soundfont)


## Bugs

Mine? Possibly. Add an issue.

Apple's? Add a Radar.
